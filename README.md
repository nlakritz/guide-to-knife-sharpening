# A Beginner's Guide to Kitchen Knife Sharpening
If you’ve ever been fortunate enough to possess a premium kitchen knife, you’ll likely try your best to keep it in top shape. However, a gradual decline in effectiveness is simply inevitable and your fancy knife will soon perform only slightly better than a blunt pair of scissors. While it may seem all hope is lost, your blade still has the potential to be fully restored! 

It’s rarely cost-effective to completely replace a slightly dull blade, but the ancient art of knife sharpening can be intimidating for many. This guide will cover the tools you’ll need and some effective sharpening techniques to bring your knife back to its former glory.

## Types of Sharpening Tools<a name="types-of-sharpening-tools"></a>
While you could theoretically sharpen a kitchen knife on any surface harder than steel, investing in a **whetstone** is your best bet. These sharpening stones are quite affordable considering the amount you’ll save in the long run. There are two common types of stones — **soaking and splash-and-go**. The former requires five minutes of soaking in water, while the later needs only a quick splash of water before it’s ready to go.

### Why a Wet Stone?
The abrasive surface of a whetstone can be rubbed against a blade edge to remove jagged metal particles on the knife, resulting in a smooth finish. If a whetstone is not lubricated with water before use, it will quickly degrade as abrasive particles are ripped off the stone and immediately packed into its pores. Water strengthens these particles and keeps them from breaking off.

Alternatives to whetstones like **pull-through sharpeners** are typically very affordable at the cost of accuracy. These function by shaving off large pieces of steel, usually producing an uneven edge and removing too much material. Even though they’re marketed for beginners, pull-through devices require a great amount of skill to produce a sharp edge.

### Knowing Your Grit
**Grit size** corresponds to the level of preciseness your stone is capable of and typically ranges from 200 to 8000. The chart below outlines how grit will guide your decision on which stone to pursue.

| Type | Grit Size | Purpose | Price* |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Coarse | < 800 | Repairing major damage | $30 |
| Medium | 800 - 2000 | General sharpening | $40 |
| Fine | > 2000 | Maintaining an already-sharp edge | $50+ |

*Approximate pricing based on 2020 estimates.

Note that some stones will have two sides, each with a different grit. While most stones will get the job done with no issues, a proven option is the Shapton Pro series.

### Other Useful Tools
It’s not absolutely necessary to have anything other than a whetstone and some water to achieve a solid knife restoration, but there are plenty of accessories to make the sharpening process easier.
* **Angle guides** allow for better control in maintaining a consistent angle throughout your sharpening stroke.
* A wooden or metal **holding base** prevents your whetstone from sliding around and catches excess water.
* A soft-tip **marker** helps you determine an optimal sharpening angle.
* A **spray bottle** makes wetting your stone convenient and mess-free.
