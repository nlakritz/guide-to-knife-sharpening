# A Beginner's Guide to Kitchen Knife Sharpening
If you’ve ever been fortunate enough to possess a premium kitchen knife, you’ll likely try your best to keep it in top shape. However, a gradual decline in effectiveness is simply inevitable and your fancy knife will soon perform only slightly better than a blunt pair of scissors. While it may seem all hope is lost, your blade still has the potential to be fully restored! 

It’s rarely cost-effective to completely replace a slightly dull blade, but the ancient art of knife sharpening can be intimidating for many. This guide will cover the tools you’ll need and some effective sharpening techniques to bring your knife back to its former glory.

## Types of Sharpening Tools<a name="types-of-sharpening-tools"></a>
While you could theoretically sharpen a kitchen knife on any surface harder than steel, investing in a **whetstone** is your best bet. These sharpening stones are quite affordable considering the amount you’ll save in the long run. There are two common types of stones — **soaking and splash-and-go**. The former requires five minutes of soaking in water, while the later needs only a quick splash of water before it’s ready to go.

### Why a Wet Stone?
A knife edge can be rubbed against the abrasive surface of a whetstone to remove jagged metal particles on the blade, resulting in a smooth finish. If a whetstone is not lubricated with water before use, it will quickly degrade as abrasive particles are ripped off the stone and immediately packed into its pores. Water strengthens these particles and keeps them from breaking off.

Alternatives to whetstones like **pull-through sharpeners** are typically very affordable at the cost of accuracy. These function by shaving off large pieces of steel, usually producing an uneven edge and removing too much material. Even though they’re marketed for beginners, pull-through devices require a great amount of skill to produce a sharp edge.

### Knowing Your Grit
**Grit size** corresponds to the level of preciseness your stone is capable of and typically ranges from 200 to 8000. The chart below outlines how grit will guide your decision on which stone to pursue.

| Type | Grit Size | Purpose | Price* |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Coarse | < 800 | Repairing major damage | $30 |
| Medium | 800 - 2000 | General sharpening | $40 |
| Fine | > 2000 | Maintaining an already-sharp edge | $50+ |

*Approximate pricing based on 2020 estimates.

Note that some stones will have two sides, each with a different grit. While most stones will get the job done with no issues, a proven option is the [Shapton Pro series](https://www.chefknivestogo.com/shaptonpro.html).

### Other Useful Tools
It’s not absolutely necessary to have anything other than a whetstone and some water to achieve a solid knife restoration, but there are plenty of accessories to make the sharpening process easier.
* **Angle guides** allow for better control in maintaining a consistent angle throughout your sharpening stroke.
* A wooden or metal **holding base** prevents your whetstone from sliding around and catches excess water.
* A soft-tip **marker** helps you determine an optimal sharpening angle.
* A **spray bottle** makes wetting your stone convenient and mess-free.

## Mastering Technique
With tools taken care of, you’re ready to begin the sharpening process. Make sure to take your time and don’t panic if you make a mistake, as most issues are repairable. Be aware that the following steps assume you're using a **non-serrated, double-beveled knife**, which has a smooth, angled edge on both sides. 

1. Set your whetstone on a stable surface like a dedicated holding base, rubber mat, or towel. Additionally, placing a cutting board under this surface is ideal, as it will prevent major damage if your knife happens to slip off. The stone should be placed perpendicular to you.

2. Ensure you have enough water to keep your whetstone consistently moist. If you have a soak stone, fully submerge it in water until bubbles stop appearing (5-10 minutes). For a splash-and-go stone, simply splash some water on its surface and rub it in. If you’re not sure of your [stone type](#types-of-sharpening-tools), it doesn’t hurt to soak it for a few minutes.

3. To make a successful sharpening stroke, first guide the knife edge over your stone in a curved motion, starting from the stone side closest to you and pushing away. At the beginning of the motion, start from the top of the knife (closest to the handle) and shift contact closer to the tip as you complete the movement. The entire length of the edge should ultimately make contact with the stone.

4. Once you complete the initial sharpening motion away from your body, complete the reverse movement without ever breaking contact between knife and stone. Sliding the tip of your blade off the stone may chip it off or even damage the stone itself.

5. For beginners, it’s highly recommended to use a Sharpie or similar marker to determine your sharpening angle. Draw a line of ink along your knive’s **bevel**, which is the inclined portion. Then, you’ll need to make a few preliminary sharpening strokes to find which angle removes the most ink. If you’d like to skip this step, a 17° angle is standard for most kitchen knives.
    1. More ink removed closer to the handle means you need to increase the angle.
    2. More ink removed closer to the tip means you need to decrease the angle.
    3. A consistent amount of ink removed along the entire bevel means you’ve found the ideal angle.

6. If you have multiple stones, start at a low grit and work your way up. Assuming you’re working on restoring a dull knife rather than maintaining a sharp one, start with a medium stone and perform 10-15 passes, also called a single **cycle**. Maintain the same amount of pressure for each stroke to achieve a consistent bevel angle.

7. After a few sharpening cycles, you’ll begin to notice a **burr**, which is a raised lip of metal. You can feel for this with your hand by pushing away from the edge and may need to complete multiple cycles before it appears. When you’re confident there is a definite burr, it’s time to remove it. *If you happen to have a finishing stone, go ahead and complete a few cycles per side with it to create a finer burr before removal.*

8. To remove a burr, simply flip the knife over and complete a cycle with very light pressure. If you put on too much pressure, you’ll create a new burr facing the opposite direction.

9. At this point, your knife should be sharpened and ready to go! Be sure to test it out on a soft fruit like a tomato, followed by a standard sheet of paper. You will need to restart the entire sharpening process if it fails to cut through either cleanly.
